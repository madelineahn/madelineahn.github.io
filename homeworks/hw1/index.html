<p>Hi, I'm Madeline! I really like frogs. (I've
been told things like "I saw a frog and it reminded me of you," or been introduced as "the 
frog person" many times.) I also really enjoy playing the piano and drawing! Here at Berkeley, I 
write species accounts for an amphibian database website as a research apprentice in the Museum
of Vertebrate Zoology. I'm also a facilitator for the Digital Art DeCal. Other than drawing or playing
the piano, I'm probably listening to indie/rock (in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English, and sometimes
French) and thinking about fictional characters. </p>

    <li>I learned that designers have to keep in mind the different use cases for an interface.
        It's easy to forget that many people may want to use the same tool/app/site for different
        purposes, until you're a part of the people who have an uncommon purpose and can't get 
        the app working like you want. It's also interesting to think about how the designers
        behind popular apps like AirBNB must have had several different iterations of designs
        before deciding that the current one is the best.</li>
    <li>My favorite part of the article was the inclusion of animations that showed how websites
        focus on certain things and have intention behind every design choice. Even choosing
        how to format the date has a purpose.</li>
    <li>"I’m sure many designs have gone through explorations where the Dates aren’t presented until
        you select a location. This makes me curious about how people search and when they 
        introduce filters to their searches."</li>
