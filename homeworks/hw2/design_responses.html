							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> White space is often underused rather than overused. I found it interesting how the author didn't seem to mention much concern about wasting space at all, because they know that smartly using white space improves readability, but also that the average website user will keep scrolling by default. I find myself worried about how far people will scroll when I'm making interfaces or graphics, so it was nice to see a web designer discuss that this concern can be trivial in comparison to the benefits of using more white space.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the mention of the Gestalt of Proximity, which states that objects closer together seem to form a group. It was nice to see the example of how this worked. The example where all the sections were close together reminded me of the coupon pages that come in the mail, with everything clustered together and fighting for your attention, while the example on the right side seemed more intentional and focused. The intentional use of white space goes far in making interaces navigable and intuitive. </p>
