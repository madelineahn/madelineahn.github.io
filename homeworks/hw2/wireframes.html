					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/wireframe img.png"> </p>
							<p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football">17776: What football will look like in the future</a></p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The website tells a speculative fiction story using unconventional media types and narrative techniques. The design accomplishes this by making the title of the work large and centered, providing a table of contents for readers to easily access different parts of the story. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I didn't like how the footer felt like an after-thought; it was just tacked to the bottom of the page for legal purposes without much thought in the design. Since the website is for a work of fiction, I moved the credits section (listing the authors, designers, etc.) to the top of the page, under the title, which is more similar to how a real book cover usually is formatted. The footer was also wider than the rest of the website, which felt unnatural, so I moved its contents to be centered. This makes the website feel more centered and even, instead of gradually widening toward the bottom. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
