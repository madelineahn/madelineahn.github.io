					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I didn't realize there were so many font-pairing websites out there! I'm usually too lazy to generate more than a few combinations of fonts when I'm making design drafts, which often ends up with me defaulting to my usual choices or getting annoyed later when I decide to change everything. Having tools that make font pairing quick and convenient is really useful, and something I'll try to use more in my workflow. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked seeing the different font intervals you could use. One of the ratios is named after note intervals in music, which is really interesting!</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "...text is one of the primary ways designers can communicate with users. Typography can make or break a design." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
