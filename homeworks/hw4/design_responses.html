					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I didn't know about the rating system for color contrast. I didn't think about how adding textures/patterns can help with color accessibility. It's also interesting to know that websites makers document their color usage, since that's useful to reference later on.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how all the examples showed a more accessible version of the mistake. It's easy to get lost in the aesthetics, but being able to compare the accessible version of the design mistake shows how important accessibility is to consider. The one with the text field error in particular was useful because I find it can be tedious to write default messages in text fields, but it's worth it in the end. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Also, when displaying things like graphs or charts, giving users the option to add texture or patterns ensures that those who are colorblind can distinguish between them without having to worry about color affecting their perception of the data." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
