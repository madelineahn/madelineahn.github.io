                            <p> I think it's interesting to see all the different places transitions can be applied to websites. They may seem trivial but add a lot, and make the interface feel much more developed. My favorites are the ones where a page rolls out with a certain shape or pattern. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part is the shopping/scrolling-related designs. When I'm designing these kind of interfaces, it feels hard to make them interesting since there's usually minimal interaction besides scrolling. This article shows how it's possible to make even scrolling more interesting. </p>

                            <p> Vlad Fedoseyev's shopping design is my favorite. I really like how the page loads in with its contents sliding in from all sides to achieve a smooth-feeling transition that draws the eye toward the center. The color/size selectors also have animations after being clicked, which makes the shopper feel satisfied after making a choice. Overall, the animations both draw and maintain your attention to that part of the page.</p>
