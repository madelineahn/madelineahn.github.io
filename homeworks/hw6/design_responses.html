						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think it's interesting that you should account for device size when determining the length of animations. The example gif with the tablet, phone, and watch is interesting because I never noticed that these devices do tend to have different animation durations. I also think it's interesting that motion blur is not recommended. I personally dislike motion blur in general, but I didn't know that not using it is actually recommended for designers. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is the repeated mentions of how slow animations can detract from the user experience. I've always found it interesting when I come across a user interface that uses animations or transitions that are long enough to leave me waiting--it makes me wonder why many of these interfaces don't implement a tap-to-skip function. A common example I can think of is in gacha games, when you're repeatedly pulling for a character.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "According to Material Design Guidelines, it is better to use an asymmetric curve to make the movement look more natural and realistic. The end of the curve must be more emphasized than its beginning, so that the duration of acceleration is shorter than that of slowing down. In this case, the user will pay more attention to the final movement of the element and thus to its new state." </p>
