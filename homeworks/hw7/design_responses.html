							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I don't have member access to the story, so if I'm honest I didn't really learn much from the short blurb I do have access to. T_T I was already familiar with Gestalt, but I forgot it's composed of four principles. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Though I can't see the whole thing, I actually really like the graphic at the top! It's a helpful and concise summary of the Gestalt principles, albeit low quality. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
