				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I didn't realizethese kinds of design decisions are called Dark Patterns. It's interesting to see that so many of them are named. It's also interesting to frame design decisions as a matter of ethics, which I find relates to the ethics course I'm taking now. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was the mention of early internet scams. This includes the disguised ads and the scam notifications. I didn't know about the LinedIn lawsuit, and it was surprising to hear about such a big company doing such unprofessional behavior. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> Brignull (2010) further explains that when we think of “bad design”, we think of the creator being sloppy or lazy but without ill intent. Dark patterns, on the other hand, are not mistakes. </p>
